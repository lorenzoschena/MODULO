This exercise presents an example of the use of mPOD and POD on a 2D vector dataset.
This dataset is the TR-PIV of an impinging jet.
More info on the test case is presented in Sec. 6 of

About the data from the Tr-PIV analysis: the sampling frequency is 2kHz.
Each file contains the X and Y coordinates (in mm) in the first two coulmns; the U and V components in m/s in the third and fourth.
