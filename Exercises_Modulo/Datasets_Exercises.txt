These are the datasets for five exercises in modal analysis, described in https://github.com/mendezVKI/MODULO.
Exercise 1--------- https://osf.io/zqrp5/download
This exercise presents an example of the use of mPOD and POD on a 1D scalar dataset.
This dataset is the velocity profile of a pulsating Poiseuille Flow. 
More info on the test case is presented in Mendez & Buchlin, TN215, 10.13140/RG.2.2.32209.02404
Exercise 2---------------https://osf.io/jhfmn/download
This exercise presents an example of the use of mPOD and POD on a 2D scalar dataset.
This dataset is constructed by adding three modes of similar energy content, to challenge the POD.
Data from Section 4 of https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09646
Exercise 3-------------https://osf.io/zgujk/download
This exercise presents an example of the use of mPOD and POD on a 2D scalar dataset.
This dataset is constructed from the CFD simulation of the 2D Navier-stokes problem in the vorticity-stream function
formulation. Data from Section 5 of https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09646
Exercise 4-------------https://osf.io/c28de/download
This exercise presents an example of the use of mPOD and POD on a 2D vector dataset.
This dataset is the TR-PIV of an impinging jet.
More info on the test case is presented in Sec. 6 of https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09646
About the data from the Tr-PIV analysis: the sampling frequency is 2kHz.
Each file contains the X and Y coordinates (in mm) in the first two coulmns; the U and V components in m/s in the third and fourth.
Exercise 5--------------------https://osf.io/47ftd/download
This exercise presents an example of the use of mPOD and POD with memory saving options on a 2D vector dataset.
This dataset is the TR-PIV of the flow past a cylinder in transient conditions.
More info on the test case is presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01971
About the data from the from the Tr-PIV analysis: the sampling frequency is 3kHz.
MESH.dat contains the X and Y coordinates (in mm). Each file called Res*.dat containes the U and V components in m/s .
