MODULO: Introduction
=====================

MODULO (MODal mULtiscale pOd) is a software developed at the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics to perform data-driven modal decompositions.
Initially focused on the Multiscale Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (mPOD), it has recently been extended to perform also other decompositions that include POD, SPODs, DFT, DMD, mPOD.

What are data-driven decompositions? Some literature
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Data-driven decompositions seek to partition a dataset as a linear combination of elementary contributions called modes.
For a brief overview of the context, we refer to: 

- Ninni, D., Mendez, M. A. (2020), "MODULO: A Software for Multiscale Proper Orthogonal Decomposition of data", Software X, Vol 12, 100622, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2020.100622.

- Poletti, R., Schena, L., Ninni, D., Mendez, M.A (2024) "MODULO: a python toolbox for data-driven modal decomposition", Submitted to Journal of Open Source Software. Preprint available at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/376885484_MODULO_a_python_toolbox_for_data-driven_modal_decomposition

The first article also presents the first version of MODULO and its GUI developed by D. Ninni (available in the Old_Matlab_Implementation branch). The second article introduces MODULO v2 from this branch and alternative open source projects.
While many projects allows for computing common decompositions such as POD, DMD and the SPODs, MODULO is currently the only opensource code allowing to compute the mPOD.

For a more comprehensive overview on the theory of data-driven decompositions, we refer to the chapter:

The pre-print is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12630.

Previous versions of MODULO
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The first version was developed in Matlab and was equipped with a GUI by D. Ninni.
A minicourse on data-driven decompositions and the usage of MODULO was provided here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED3x00H4yN4&list=PLEJZLD0-4PeKW6Ze984q08bNz28GTntkR&index=1

Although much of the material covered in these videos is still relevant, a new version of this minicourse is being prepared.
This is a compressed version of the course "Data-Driven Modal Analysis" that I give as part of the Research Master Program at the von Karman Institute (https://www.vki.ac.be/index.php/research-master-in-fluid-dynamics)

This first MODULO version implemented POD, DFT and mPOD and was already equipped with the first version of the memory-saving feature.
The GUI was also available as an executable that the user could install without needing a Matlab license.

This first version is still accessible from the branch "Old_Matlab_Implementation", but it is no longer maintained.

The main functions were then imported to Python, and L. Schena developed the first package PyPi.
A tutorial on how to use that version is given here: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2uSvdxAwHk&list=PLEJZLD0-4PeKW6Ze984q08bNz28GTntkR&index=9

The current architecture of MODULO v2 is built from that version but has been considerably expanded. This first Python version is still accessible from the branch "Old_Python_Implementation" together with the first (unpackaged) versions of the codes. These are still used in some courses for didactic purposes.
